# Enrichment

![[Enrichment — hero.png]]

Say **"enrich [page]"** and the whole [[The Shop|Shop]] goes to work on one page, until it does what text can't: you hear the claim, play the equation, watch the idea move. What comes out is the page's **rich face** — the entry's own words as the spine, read live from the `.md`, with sound, image and interaction laid beside the headings they serve.

The plain page stays plain. The `.md` is the considered truth and keeps its beauty in Obsidian; the rich face is a reading of it, not a copy ([[SCHEMA]] §1). Enrichment tends — not as a strict rule — to place what it makes in the rich face and leave the text alone; the text still keeps what it needs to be understood, like formulas and essential graphics. When making teaches the text something, an edit that changes no claim is shown to Loudon before it's written; a finding that changes what the page says goes home through the [[Deposit Ceremony]]'s map, which he approves.

## Trigger

*"Enrich [page]"*, *"enrich this page"*, *"let's enrich [page]"*. One page at a time — depth, not coverage.

## The rich face

In [[STIGMERGY]] the face switch at the right of an entry's top bar reaches it — `F` cycles text, rich, scroll — once the bundle holds the manifest. The direct address is `http://localhost:5173/rich/?entry=<Entry>`, or `node _ops/rich-face/rich-server.mjs` serves the same page at `http://127.0.0.1:8842/?entry=<Entry>`. Any entry opens there; one that hasn't been enriched shows its text and the media it already embeds.

- **Three kinds of material, each labelled.** Figures the text already carries render as media, with their captions. Pieces the Shop *gathered* from the bundle and pieces it *made* live in a manifest, `[Entry]/[Entry] — rich.json`, keyed by heading. Small pieces sit in the margin beside their paragraph; video and interactives span the page beneath it. A page may carry a low room-tone bed.
- **Made pieces live in the bundle** as `[Entry] — rich — <what>.<ext>`, self-describing like any bundle file; a coherent set of files gets one folder named for what the set is. Gathered pieces keep their names. A piece's `near` places it beside the paragraph or figure it clarifies, not at the bottom.
- **The review is built in.** Every section has a note (◇); the dock sends them to the board as a `human_eval` from TRICKSTER ([[Review Layer]]).
- **Sibling of [[The Scroll]].** The scroll shows what a page has *made*, newest first; the rich face shows the page's *idea*, in the order of the idea.

The renderer, its server and the fingerprint tool are `_ops/rich-face/` (README there: the manifest format, the piece gotchas). A rich face is a whole page — not STIGMERGY's *inline rich content*, the artifacts a single board message can carry.

## The steps

0. **Open with the tail read of [[Enrichment — tuning]]** ([[SCHEMA — Reference]] §6). Those are this run's first candidates for a spec change.
1. **Read the entry whole, then its bundle. Gather first.** The forward vector is the brief: the page should be made rich in the direction it already leans. Bundles hold media nothing links to — narrations, beds, renders from earlier rounds. The placement tendency, in Loudon's own words, not smoothed: "Now that we have the rich face, we should tend to place enrichments in the rich face and keep the main page text, but do not hold this as a strict rule. If a diagram or image is really necessary for understanding the text, like if the text is talking about an image, or a signal flow diagram is fundamental to understanding the text, then we leave it in. Enrichments are not necessary for understanding the text, leave in the text what is necessary (like formulas, and essential graphics)."
2. **Walk it section by section** and ask one question: what can only be shown, heard or played here? Prefer a piece that **tests the section's claim** over one that illustrates it — or one that shows what the section takes for granted without saying ([[Latent Error]]). A piece with nothing to test and nothing to make felt doesn't ship.
3. **Make it with the Shop**, at one tier for the whole page — a Sketch tonight, a Study, a Piece over days. The [[Maker]] picks the Specialists. Equations appear twice, symbols and words ([[Loudon Live Design System]]).
4. **Verify what can be verified.** Run each piece's engine against the claim it makes; load the page and read the console. Name what you couldn't check — an agent can't hear the mix.
5. **Stamp** each section: `node _ops/rich-face/fingerprint.mjs "<Entry>" --stamp`.
6. **Carry findings home, split by what they change.** When making a piece teaches the text something: an edit that changes no claim — a unit fixed, a symbol renamed to match the piece — is shown to Loudon before it's written, then re-stamp that section. A finding that changes what the page *says* goes home through the [[Deposit Ceremony]]'s map, which Loudon approves, before it's written.
7. **Commit** `enrich(<Entry>): <what> — <tier>`. The body names the version the run ran under, what was and wasn't verified, and what this run taught the ceremony ("nothing" is a legal answer); the run marks the tuning file with its run line, and a lesson that changed the spec also goes there as a numbered item.

## Drift — how the two faces stay honest

Drift is disclosed, not prevented ([[Drift and Consolidation]]); when the faces disagree, the text wins.

- **Words can't drift.** The rich face never holds the entry's words; it reads them on every look and re-reads every few seconds.
- **Placement** can: a renamed heading strands its pieces in *Lost its place*, never dropped — with *probably a rename* when the words under a new heading match the old stamp. A piece whose anchor phrase is gone moves to its section's end, and says why.
- **Meaning** can, and a machine can't see it. Each section of the manifest is stamped with a fingerprint of the prose its pieces were made against; when the prose changes, those pieces carry *made against an earlier version of this section*. The re-tune reads only flagged sections and decides per piece: still true (re-stamp that section), remake, or retire.

## Postcondition

The manifest's sections all read *in step* under `fingerprint.mjs`; every made piece is in the bundle, named and self-describing; the manifest sits in the bundle, so the reader's face switch offers the rich face; the page renders at `/rich/` with a clean console and its review dock; the commit body says what was verified and what wasn't.
