## Move

Make ProjectsDeck's readyRows skip SKIP_STAGES, matching batch-due.js.

## Why this move matters

The PROJECTS deck can call a dormant page *ready to advance* when the heartbeat would turn the same page away by stage. Two readers of one rule disagree, and the deck is the one Loudon sees.

## Current state

`_ops/stigmergy/app/src/components/projects/ProjectsDeck.jsx:191` builds `readyRows` from stewarded rows with an answer waiting and nothing running or queued, with no stage check. `_ops/stigmergy/orchestrator/src/batch-due.js:14` defines `SKIP_STAGES` (`dormant`, `composting`), and `dueForCycle` at :30 refuses by stage first. This is a second move on the page; the open baton beside it (`Project Stewardship System — baton.md`) is the entry trim, and the two don't share a file. Carried off the Palace To-Do at its retirement, on Loudon's call of 2026-10-25.

## Next move

Check that the deck's row data carries the stage, then filter `readyRows` by the same set, imported or mirrored, with a test. App code goes in a worktree of its own.

## Load these files first

`ProjectsDeck.jsx` around :191 · `batch-due.js` :14 and :30

## On pickup (fixed — the catcher's checklist; do not rewrite per session)
*Identical in every baton. It rides along because the catching Claude loads the
baton and the entry, not this ceremony — so the catcher's obligations live where
the catcher will see them. Omit nothing here.*
A pickup has two beats: **claim** it when you catch it, **close** it when the move lands. The card stays visible in between — a claim that ages with no close is how a dropped baton (a "fumble") surfaces instead of vanishing. (A parent-entry baton that was never announced on the board has no card; skip the board posts — just remove the pointer and delete the file at close, step 8.)

**Catch it — claim:**
1. State the move back in one sentence. If you can't, the baton wasn't caught — stop and ask Loudon.
2. Check it may already be done before you commit to it. The baton is a snapshot from when it was written; the project may have moved past it. Re-read the parent entry and `git log` it since the baton's `born` date, and confirm the "Current state" the baton quotes still matches the file. For a board-announced baton, `node _ops/stigmergy/pickup-handoff.mjs <id>` prints exactly this reconciliation view — every commit that touched the entry since the baton posted — and then claims the card, so run it and read the list *before* you continue. If the move is already done, superseded, or no longer wanted, STOP — do not claim it; surface to Loudon, and if it plainly landed already, close it as a reconciler (step 7). A stale baton followed silently produces drift. (The auto-staleness heuristic is off by design — the freshness call is yours.)
3. If this baton or its board line is still uncommitted, commit them first. That commit is the git archive step 8 relies on.
4. Claim it. For a board-announced baton (it shows in `list-handoffs`), the `pickup-handoff.mjs` from step 2 has already posted the claim (`handoff_picked_up`, `lifecycle: claim`) — the card moves to **CLAIMED (in flight)**; it does *not* leave the board. Leave the "Active Baton" pointer and the baton file in place for now — they come out at close, so a fumble mid-move never erases the work.
5. If the baton names a receiving-surface capability delta or a worktree coordinate, confirm it holds before relying on it — for a worktree, check `git worktree list` and recreate it (`node _ops/worktree/new-worktree.mjs --name <branch> --profile <p>`) if it is gone. A build that was supposed to run here but can't is a finding to report, not a failure to hide.
6. Act on the move, holding the calibrations above.

**Close it — when the move lands:**
7. Post the close. `node _ops/stigmergy/close-handoff.mjs <id | entry> --commit <hash>` retires the card — an explicit close is the *only* thing that clears it (done is never inferred). Cite the commit that landed the move: it makes the close a checkable claim, not a self-report. **Complete, or re-baton the rest:** if you finished the whole move, close plain; if you did only part, `--partial --remainder "<what's left>"` posts the leftover as a fresh `handoff_ready` so it reappears as open work. Never let "in the spirit of the original" quietly drop scope — a gap becomes a new baton, not silence.
8. Delete the baton file (git is its archive) and remove the "Active Baton" section from the parent entry. Steward batons are the exception — updated in place, never deleted or closed, until their page ends and the steward leaves stewardship.
